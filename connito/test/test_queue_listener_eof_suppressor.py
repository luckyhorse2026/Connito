"""Pin the contract of `_install_queue_listener_eof_suppressor`.

The bug it silences leaks from a stdlib QueueListener thread inside
the HF download subprocess. We don't reproduce the full HF chain in
unit tests — that needs network and a HuggingFace subprocess. Instead
we directly invoke the installed `threading.excepthook` with the same
shape of args the real failure produces and verify:

  1. EOFError with a thread named `Thread-N (_monitor)` is swallowed
     (the original fallback hook is NOT invoked).
  2. EOFError in any other thread name surfaces to the fallback.
  3. RuntimeError (or any non-EOFError) in a `_monitor` thread
     surfaces to the fallback — we don't blanket-suppress monitor
     threads.

`threading.excepthook` looks up `threading.__excepthook__` at install
time and stores it as the fallback. To capture what would have
escaped, we patch `threading.__excepthook__` to a recording function
BEFORE installing the suppressor, then synthesise `ExceptHookArgs`
and invoke the installed hook directly.
