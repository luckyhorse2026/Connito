"""Pin the version-range gate skip for the miner role in `filter_checkpoints`.

The gate compares each chain commit's ``global_ver`` against
``[min_allowed_version, max_allowed_version]`` and silently drops any
miner whose chain commit happens to be 1-2 blocks off the window. We
observed this in SN102 staging:

    filter_checkpoints: excluded (version exceeds max allowed)
        ckpt_ver=8338209  max_allowed_version=8338208  uid=131

— a miner that committed one block after the validator's expected
window was excluded, even though its actual checkpoint was fresh.

The fix: skip the version-range gate when ``for_role == "miner"``.
Validators downstream do their own evaluation-driven gating, so any
junk submission gets caught there. Validators evaluating each other's
commits (``for_role="validator"``) still need the gate because the
selected majority hash propagates into model state — that path is
unchanged.
