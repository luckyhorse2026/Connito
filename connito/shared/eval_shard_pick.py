"""Seeded shard-pick + mod-offset for eval-data sampling.

Replaces the older `.shuffle(seed) + .skip(small)` pattern in
`get_tokenised_dataset` for the validator eval path, which can only
reach the head ~`shuffle_buffer + skip_max` rows of whichever shard a
seed permutes to position 0. With ~50 k + 50 k that's the first ~100 k
rows of each shard — i.e. ~70 % of every C4-en shard is unreachable
forever regardless of how long the network runs.

The pick scheme decomposes "skip N rows into the dataset" as:

    pick_shard(N // rows_per_shard) + skip(N % rows_per_shard)

- The shard pick is O(1): it selects which HF parquet/json.gz file to
  open via `data_files=[chosen]`. No bytes downloaded by the pick
  itself; the subsequent stream fetches only that one shard.
- The in-shard offset is bounded by ONE shard's row count (a few
  hundred thousand) instead of the dataset's (hundreds of millions).
  Worst-case decode-and-discard is seconds per source per round.

Across rounds with rotating seeds, every shard is eventually picked
and every row within it is eventually offset-to. Whole-dataset reach
with per-round cost bounded by one shard.

Sizing the in-shard offset bound — path B (safe floor) vs path A (per-shard table)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`.skip(N)` past end-of-stream silently exhausts the iterator; the
default `interleave_datasets(stopping_strategy="first_exhausted")` then
collapses the whole eval round to zero (or short) batches. The offset
mod-bound must therefore be ≤ (actual shard rows) − (downstream
consumption + safety margin).

Two ways to learn "actual shard rows":

  * Path A — per-shard exact counts. Maximum reach (every row
    reachable). Cost: enumerate every shard once (hours for C4-en
    json.gz which has no footer; one HTTP-range read per parquet
    shard for Nemotron).

  * Path B — a per-source SAFE FLOOR constant. Lossy by
    construction: rows past the floor are unreachable. For
    publisher-balanced datasets (C4: shard sizes 356,317 or 356,318
    across all spot-checked samples) the loss is small enough that
    we pay it in exchange for zero per-shard accounting.

This module implements path B. The policy registry declares either:

  * `row_count_source="constant"` → use `safe_floor_rows` as the bound
    for every shard. Validated at module load against a small set of
    `verified_shard_rows` so a typo or stale config (safe_floor too
    high relative to actual shard sizes) raises BEFORE any round
    picks land short.

  * `row_count_source="parquet_footer"` → read `num_rows` from the
    parquet footer at pick time. Cheap (~32 KB HTTP-range fetch).
    Bound = `actual_rows − min_headroom_rows`.

Anti-memorization properties are unchanged from today:
    * Shard selection AND in-shard offset are both seed-derived, so a
      miner who can compute `combined_seed` can predict the exact rows.
    * The defense is therefore (i) `combined_seed` itself mixes the
      late-bound MinerCommit2 block hash (see
      `connito/shared/cycle.py:_get_minercommit2_block_hash`), and
      (ii) the per-round reachable pool (one shard × `safe_floor` rows
      ≈ ~340 k) is wide enough that overfitting within the remaining
      commit window is infeasible.

Consensus depends on every validator deriving an IDENTICAL shard list.
That requires:
    1. A pinned dataset revision (commit SHA, not `main`) per source.
       Without this, HF reordering / adding / replacing shards mid-
       rollout would cause two validators to pick different rows for
       the same seed and break weight consensus for that round.
    2. Deterministic file-list sort (plain lexicographic on the full
       `siblings.rfilename`).
    3. The `safe_floor_rows` / `min_headroom_rows` constants must
       match across validators — they live in code (this module), not
       config, so the rollout discipline is just "deploy the same
       commit." Operators MUST re-verify `verified_shard_rows` and
       bump `safe_floor_rows` together if the upstream dataset is
       ever re-uploaded with different shard sizes.

# Per-source shard-list filter, revision pin, and offset-bound policy.
#
# `path_prefix`/`path_suffix` are matched against the dataset's
# `siblings.rfilename` list. The pair is intentionally narrow rather
# than a glob: silent over-matching (e.g. picking up `validation/`
# files or `noblocklist` variants) would not raise at config time and
# would only manifest as cross-validator consensus breaks. Keep these
# explicit per source.
#
# `revision` pins to a commit SHA when possible. `"main"` is a moving
# target; using it accepts a small consensus-break risk in exchange
# for not having to ship a config update every time HF re-uploads.
# Operators who care should override via `eval_source_revision_pin`
# in DataCfg.
#
# `row_count_source` selects how the in-shard offset bound is
# resolved:
#   - "constant": use `safe_floor_rows` directly. Required for
#     formats without a footer (json.gz). Lossy by construction —
#     rows past the floor are unreachable. Validated at module load
#     against `verified_shard_rows`.
#   - "parquet_footer": read `num_rows` from the parquet footer at
#     pick time. Cheap (~32 KB HTTP range). Bound becomes
#     `actual_rows − min_headroom_rows`.
#
# `safe_floor_rows`: the offset bound for constant-source policies.
# Must be set strictly less than `min(verified_shard_rows.values())
# − min_headroom_rows`, enforced at module load.
#
# `min_headroom_rows`: rows guaranteed to remain available in the
# source AFTER the skip lands. Sized for the downstream pipeline's
# per-round consumption — see `dataloader.py:281` comment:
# `~max_eval_batches × world_size / vali_fraction ≈ 5 000` total /
# 2 sources = ~2 500 per source. Default 10 000 gives a 4× safety
# margin for filter / split / interleave variance and unusual configs.
#
# `verified_shard_rows`: empirically-counted row counts for a small
# spot-check sample of shards (not the full set). Used at module load
# to validate `safe_floor_rows`, and at runtime as documentation of
# what the policy was sized against. Empty for footer-based sources.
