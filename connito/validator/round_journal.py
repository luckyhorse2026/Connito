"""Per-round mutation journal for the validator.

Records every score / failure / freeze-zero event that lands on the live
``Round`` to disk, so a kill before ``finalize_round_scores`` runs (SIGKILL,
OOM, segfault, eval-window timeout) does not lose the bg-eval / foreground
work for that round. On the next clean startup, ``finalize_round_scores``
can be replayed against any unfinalized journal so the aggregator on disk
ends up identical to what it would have been without the kill.

File layout: ``<checkpoint_path>/round_journal/round_<round_id>.json``.
One file per round_id, kept after finalize as an audit log; pruned by
age (``8 × cycle_length``) at the same site that prunes the aggregator.

Persistence pattern mirrors ``connito/validator/cohort_state.py``:
schema-version envelope, atomic tmp-file + ``os.fsync`` + ``os.replace``,
``load()`` validates the schema version.

    **Metrics only — this must never mutate scoring state.** It exists
    because startup recovery works by *replaying* `finalize_round_scores`,
    which marks the journal finalized; the recovery loop then skips
    finalized journals, so a second restart re-emits nothing and the
    dashboard loses the whole last completed cycle (observed 2026-07-31:
    two Watchtower restarts 25 minutes apart left every per-miner family at
    zero series for 17 minutes).

    Re-running finalize instead would be actively harmful, and not for the
    obvious reason: `finalize_round_scores` calls `drop_round` first, so the
    aggregator's *point set* would stay correct — but `add_score` stamps
    `_utc_now()`, so the round's points would get fresh timestamps and jump
    to the end of the time-ordered series. The rolling average is "last
    `max_points` **by timestamp**", and that average is what drives weight
    submission, so a re-finalize would silently reshuffle the scoring
    window. Hence: read the journal, set gauges, touch nothing else.

    `score_aggregator` is read (never written) for the latest/avg/samples
    snapshot, which lives in the aggregator rather than the journal. Pass
    `None` to skip those three gauges.
