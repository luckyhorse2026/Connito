    Drops every aggregator point tagged with `round.round_id` first so
    intermediate eval-time scores do not stack with the rank-based ones,
    then re-adds:

      - Top-1 by `round.scores` (delta desc): score 2.25.

    Operational failures (download timeout, eval timeout, OOM, unexpected

    so finalize deliberately writes nothing for them — their prior EMA
    is preserved. The validator's lack of compute / bandwidth must not
    dock a miner's reward.

    Likewise, miners we never reached (submission never landed, or
    bg-eval ran out of time before claiming) are absent from every set
    and receive no entry. They keep their prior EMA and the next
    round's stalest-first prioritization gives them another shot.

    All GPU work — `load_model_from_path`, dataloader build, and

    can run the entire eval as one `asyncio.to_thread` task.

    That structure matters for cancellation: tasks scheduled via
    `asyncio.to_thread` are not cancellable, so when an outer
    `asyncio.wait_for` timeout fires, the awaiter is cancelled but the
    underlying thread keeps running. If the thread is partway through
    `copy.deepcopy(base_model)` or `model.to(device)`, the GPU memory it
    has allocated is still live; starting a second eval in parallel will
    OOM. Funnelling the whole eval through one `to_thread` task lets
    callers acquire any GPU lock INSIDE that thread — the lock release
    then tracks actual GPU completion (not awaiter cancellation), so the
    next eval naturally blocks on lock acquisition until the previous
    thread drains.

    `deadline_monotonic` is forwarded to `evaluate_model`, which checks
    it between batches and raises `EvalDeadlineExceeded` cleanly. The
    caller's `with` block then unwinds and releases the lock — covers
    the case where the eval genuinely stalls on GPU and `wait_for`

    Walks `round_obj.foreground_uids` only and calls `evaluate_one_miner`
    for each. Miner checkpoints are made available locally by the
    `BackgroundDownloadWorker` (HF); this function does not pull from HF
    itself. UIDs that exceed the per-miner budget or fail to land by
    `end_block` are left unclaimed so the `BackgroundEvalWorker` can pick
    them up in step 3.

    If `completed_out` is provided, finished `MinerEvalJob`s are appended
    to that list as they complete (in addition to being returned at the
    end). Callers wrap this coroutine with `asyncio.wait_for` to enforce
    a wall-clock cap; on cancellation the local return value is lost,
    but `completed_out` retains every miner that finished scoring before
    the deadline. `list.append` is atomic, so there is no partial-append
    race during cancellation.
