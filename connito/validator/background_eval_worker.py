"""Step (3) of the round lifecycle: GPU-bound background evaluation.

Active only inside the (3) window: from end of Validate(K) to end of
Train(K+1). Pulls UIDs from `Round.downloaded_pool` and runs
`evaluate_one_miner` against this worker's own `eval_base_model` (loaded
once per round from `round.model_snapshot_cpu`, so Merge(K) cannot
change the round's reference state mid-evaluation).

GPU-lock yielding invariant: `gpu_eval_lock` is acquired only for the
narrow `load_state_dict` and `evaluate_one_miner` calls. It MUST NOT be
held across `await`, across `Event.wait`, or across iteration
boundaries.
