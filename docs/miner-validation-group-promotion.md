# Miner promotion through validation Groups A → B → C

Connito's tiered scheme places every miner into one of three validation
groups each cycle. The group determines whether the miner is evaluated,
by which validators, and how much chain weight they can earn. This doc
describes the conditions under which a miner enters each tier and the
promotion path from new arrival (Group C) up to the heavily rewarded
consensus tier (Group A).

The construction logic lives in `connito/validator/round_groups.py` and
is invoked by `Round.freeze()` (`connito/validator/round.py`) at the
start of every cycle's Submission phase.

## 0. Becoming eligible — the chain-commit gates

Everything below this section assumes your miner is already in
`validator_miner_assignment.miners_with_checkpoint`. That set is the
output of a four-stage filter applied at the start of every cycle's
Submission phase. If your miner doesn't land in it, no validator
evaluates you and you cannot earn into Groups A/B/C this cycle —
regardless of your model quality.

The gates run in this order. Failing any one drops the commit
silently (debug-level log on the validator side).

### Gate A — role gating (`shared/chain.py:get_chain_commits`)

For each on-chain commitment on the subnet:

1. **Hotkey must be in the metagraph** at the queried block. Deregistered
   hotkeys are skipped (`Skipping commit from hotkey not in metagraph`).
2. **Commit JSON must parse** as a `MinerChainCommit`. Schema mismatch
   (missing required fields, wrong types) → dropped with
   `Failed to parse chain commit`.
3. **Hotkey must be classified as a miner, not a validator.** Role
   gating uses two signals from the previous phase:
   - `is_whitelisted = hotkey in whitelisted_validators` (from
     `get_validator_whitelist_from_api`), AND
   - `is_weight_fresh = (current_block − neuron.last_update) ≤ cycle_length`.

   A hotkey is treated as a validator only if **both** are true.
   Whitelisted but stale, or fresh but not whitelisted → miner. Plain
   miners pass through with neither signal set.

### Gate B — checkpoint completeness (`shared/checkpoints.py:filter_checkpoints`, `for_role="miner"`)

After role gating, the validator joins your **signed-hash commit** and
your **hash commit** into a single `ChainCheckpoint` and runs the
completeness filter:

4. **Every required field must be present** on the joined checkpoint:
   `signed_model_hash`, `model_hash`, `global_ver`, `expert_group`,
   `uid`, `ip`, `port`, `hotkey`. Any missing field → excluded with
   `filter_checkpoints: excluded (incomplete)`.
5. The **`global_ver` version-range gate is skipped for miners.**
   `filter_checkpoints` logs `skipping version range gate (miner role)`
   and passes the commit through regardless of how far `global_ver`
   sits from the current cycle's window. The gate still applies when
   `for_role == "validator"` (cross-validator agreement on the
   majority hash), but a miner's commit will never be dropped here for
   a version reason. (Rationale: chain-commit blocks can race the
   `min_allowed_version` / `max_allowed_version` window by 1–2 blocks,
   silently dropping fresh, otherwise-valid miner submissions; see
   commit `f53c49b`.)
6. Miners are **not** subject to the majority-hash filter that gates
   validators — that step is skipped when `for_role == "miner"`. Your
   `model_hash` can differ from the consensus and you still pass.

### Gate C — join requirement (`shared/checkpoints.py:build_chain_checkpoints_from_previous_phase`)

The completeness check runs against a `ChainCheckpoint` that is
already the join of two on-chain commits per hotkey, each pulled at
its own block:

7. You must have **both** commitments posted, indexed by hotkey:
   - A **signed-hash commit** carrying `signed_model_hash` (the small
     signature payload).
   - A **hash commit** carrying `model_hash`, `global_ver`,
     `expert_group`, `inner_opt`, `hf_repo_id`, `hf_revision`.

   A hotkey that posted only one of the two has its other half come
   back as `None`, fails Gate B (missing `signed_model_hash` or
   `model_hash`), and is excluded as incomplete.

**At which block each commit is pulled.** `build_chain_checkpoints_from_previous_phase`
calls `get_blocks_from_previous_phase_from_api(config)` — a request to
the cycle API at `https://cycle-api.connito.ai:443/previous_phase_blocks` —
to retrieve the exact `[start, end]` block range for every phase of
the **previous** cycle. It then issues two archive reads:

- **Signed-hash commit** (for `for_role="miner"`): read at
  `commit_1_end_block = previous_phase_range[MinerCommit1][1] + 1`
  — i.e. one block **after** the end of the previous cycle's
  `MinerCommit1` window. Any signed-hash commit posted strictly
  inside that window is in scope; commits posted later (or earlier
  than the prior `MinerCommit1`) are invisible to this read.
- **Hash commit** (for `for_role="miner"`): read at
  `commit_2_end_block = previous_phase_range[MinerCommit2][1] + 1`
  — one block after the previous cycle's `MinerCommit2` window. Same
  rule: commits must land inside `MinerCommit2` to be picked up.

Both reads use the archive subtensor (`config.chain.network`); the
function refuses to use the lite endpoint because historical
`block=N` queries don't resolve on pruned nodes.

**Phase-overlap guard.** If `get_phase_from_api` reports the
validator is currently *inside* `MinerCommit1` or `MinerCommit2`
when this function is called, it `wait_till(config, Submission)`
before reading — so commits posted while a window is still open
never race the validator's read. The reads happen against blocks
that are already committed history by the time the call lands.

**Operator takeaway.** Your commits must be on-chain **before the
last block of the corresponding commit phase ends**. The validator
reads at `phase_end + 1`, so the latest you can post is the same
block the phase closes. Posting one block late means your commit
won't be considered until the *following* cycle — by which time
your `global_ver` may be outside the version-range window (Gate B
step 5) and dropped anyway.

### Gate D — assignment cap (`shared/cycle.py:get_validator_miner_assignment`)

The miner set that survives A–C is passed to assignment. Two more
filters apply:

8. **Hotkey must appear in both** the miner set (from `get_miners_from_commit`)
   AND the post-filter `chain_checkpoints_by_hotkey`. The intersection
   is logged on miss as `excluding miners without chain checkpoint`.
9. **Incentive-rank cap.** The surviving miners are sorted by
   `metagraph.incentive` desc (tiebreaker: hotkey asc for determinism
   across validators), then truncated to
   `cap = config.evaluation.foreground_top_n × num_validators`.
   Miners beyond the cap are dropped from foreground assignment with
   `dropped low-incentive miners beyond capacity`, but **are kept in
   `all_miners_with_checkpoint`** — the bg-download/eval workers still
   pull them for subnet-wide coverage. Only the foreground assignment
   (the set the validator commits chain weights against this cycle)
   respects the cap.

### Cheat-sheet checklist for miner operators

To make your chain commit count toward `validator_miner_assignment` this
cycle:

- [ ] Hotkey is registered on the subnet at the freeze block.
- [ ] You posted **two** commits this commit phase: a signed-hash commit
      AND a hash commit (one without the other = silent drop).
- [ ] The hash commit JSON contains every field: `model_hash`,
      `global_ver`, `expert_group`, `inner_opt`, `hf_repo_id`,
      `hf_revision`. Schema must parse as `MinerChainCommit`.
- [ ] Axon `ip` and `port` are reachable (served via `Axon.serve` at
      startup — without this the joined checkpoint is missing `ip`/`port`
      and fails Gate B).
- [ ] You are **not** misclassified as a validator: either don't appear
      on the validator whitelist (the typical case for miners), or
      ensure your `last_update` is stale enough that role gating
      classifies you as a miner.
- [ ] Your `metagraph.incentive` puts you in the top
      `foreground_top_n × num_validators` slice (default `5 × N`).
      Below this rank, only background eval picks you up — you do not
      contribute to A/B/C rewards this cycle. This is the only gate
      that scales with subnet activity rather than your own actions.

Common failure modes seen in production validator logs:

- `excluding miners without chain checkpoint` → either you only posted
  the signed-hash commit (no hash commit yet), or the hash commit
  arrived after the previous phase's deadline window closed.
- `Failed to parse chain commit` → your JSON shape doesn't match
  `MinerChainCommit`. Inspect the schema in
  `connito/shared/chain.py` and the model in
  `connito/shared/checkpoints.py`.
- No log line at all for your hotkey → role gating treated you as a
  validator. Check whether your hotkey is on the cycle API's validator
  whitelist.

## The three validation groups

| Group | Role | Size | Where it comes from |
|-------|------|------|---------------------|
| **A** | Consensus tier — miners already heavily rewarded by the rest of the subnet | up to 13 (shares budget with B) | Chain-set top-3 tally (`metagraph.weights`) |
| **B** | Candidate tier — miners on the chain-set top-5 but not yet hitting Group A's gates | `13 − \|A\|` | Chain-set top-5 tally (`cfg.weight_group_2_size`) |
| **C** | Exploration tier — every other registered miner, partitioned across validators | up to `validation_group_c_size` (default 17) per validator | Seeded `assign_miners_to_validators` over `(all miners) \\ (A ∪ B)` |

`|A| + |B|` is capped at `validation_group_ab_total` (default 13)
globally; Group A absorbs every miner clearing both gates and Group B
fills the remainder. Group C is per-validator, so two validators see
different Group C rosters.

Source helpers (all in `round_groups.py`):

- Group A: `compute_group_a` (line 157)
- Group B: `compute_group_b` (line 193)
- Group C: `compute_group_c` (line 260)
- Single entry point: `build_cohort_groups` (line 401)

## Conditions for entering each group

### Group C — the entry point

A miner lands in some validator's Group C as soon as it:

1. Is registered on the subnet (present in `metagraph.hotkeys`).
2. Is **not** in the global `A ∪ B` set this cycle.
3. Is assigned to that validator by the seeded round-robin partition
   (`connito.shared.cycle.assign_miners_to_validators`).

Group C is the default placement; no positive signal is required. The
Group C roster is capped at `cfg.validation_group_c_size` miners per
validator.

**Why it matters:** miners in Group C are evaluated by their assigned
validator and earn local score points. Without Group C exposure a
fresh miner accumulates no history and cannot clear the upper tiers'
weight-emission gates.

### Group B — top-`(13 − |A|)` of the chain-set top-5 tally

A miner enters Group B when:

1. At least one **qualified validator** placed them in their on-chain
   weight Group 2 (top-`cfg.weight_group_2_size`, default 5) last
   cycle. "Qualified" means the validator hotkey is recognized by
   `validator_miner_assignment` — stale, deregistered, or
   unrecognized validators are ignored.
2. They are not already in Group A (Group A drains first; Group B
   takes only the remaining `13 − |A|` slots).
3. After excluding Group A, they rank in the top of the chain-set
   tally by **total weight received**.

Tiebreaker: validator count desc, then UID asc. There is no
per-validator weight floor for Group B — this is the candidate tier.

The tally is computed by `read_chain_set_top_k(k=cfg.weight_group_2_size)`
reading directly from `metagraph.weights`.

### Group A — top of consensus, with a 3 % per-validator floor

A miner enters Group A when **both** gates clear:

1. **Count gate.** At least `cfg.group_a_min_consensus` qualified
   validators (default `1`) placed them in their on-chain weight
   Group 1 (top-3) last cycle.
2. **Per-validator weight gate.** At least one of those validators
   emitted **strictly more than `cfg.group_a_min_weight_per_validator`**
   of their total weight to this miner — default **3 %**. (Implemented
   as `max_weight_from_one_validator > min_weight_per_validator` in the
   chain-set tally.)

The cap is `cfg.validation_group_ab_total` (13). If more than 13 miners
clear both gates, the highest aggregate `total_weight_received` win;
ties break on validator count desc, then UID asc.

Source: `read_chain_set_top_k(k=cfg.weight_group_1_size)` (top-3
ballots) followed by `compute_group_a`.

---

## The promotion path: C → B → A

A miner can climb the tiers only by accumulating chain-set votes —
**what other validators emit on chain**, not what the local validator
has scored:

1. **C → B (chain-set Group 2).** Receive non-zero weight from any
   qualified validator's top-5 ballot. Each validator builds that
   ballot from its **local rolling-average** score history — see
   "Local weight emission" below — so in practice scoring well in
   Group C against multiple validators is the path: each validator's
   local avg pushes you into its on-chain top-5, and the chain-set
   tally then pulls you into the global Group B next cycle.

2. **B → A (chain-set Group 1).** Receive **> 3 %** weight from at
   least one qualified validator's top-3 ballot. This requires being
   one of the very best miners in some validator's local rolling avg
   AND clearing the per-validator weight floor. Group B exposure is
   where you collect those votes — multiple validators' top-3 ballots
   accumulate via the chain-set tally and pull you into A.

Cohort timing: as of the current `master`, the cohort is rebuilt
**every cycle** — `maybe_advance_cohort` always re-runs the election
and rebuilds the groups (`round_groups.py:505`). Validation groups can
shift cycle-by-cycle as chain weights change; there is no 8-cycle hold
even though `cohort_window_cycles` still appears in the config.

---

## Local weight emission — how this validator votes

Validation groups (A/B/C) decide *who gets evaluated*. The local
weight ballots decide *who this validator rewards on chain*, and they
have additional history gates layered on top.

The two ballots are emitted from
`connito/validator/run.py` right after `finalize_round_scores`:

**Weight Group 1 — `cfg.weight_group_1_share` (default 98 %), top-`cfg.weight_group_1_size` (default 3) of A ∪ B by aggregator avg:**

- Local score-aggregator avg ranking, restricted to `A ∪ B`.
- Miner must have **≥ 3** score records in the aggregator.
- Miner must have scores recorded under **≥ 3 distinct `round_id`s
  within the last `5 × cycle_length` blocks** — i.e. scored in at
  least **3 of the last 5 cycles**. The window is
  `[current_round_id − 5 × cycle_length, current_round_id]`. Multiple
  records at the same `round_id` count as 1; the gate is on distinct
  round_ids. See `count_distinct_round_ids_in_range` on
  `MinerScoreAggregator`.
- **Empty-Group-1 guard:** if no UID clears the gates, the 98 % share
  is redirected to `uid = 0` (subnet owner) rather than dropped.
  This keeps the validator's total emission at 100 % so its
  consensus signal is not diluted while it waits for a miner to
  clear the recency gate.

**Weight Group 2 — `cfg.weight_group_2_share` (default 2 %), top-`cfg.weight_group_2_size` (default 5) of A ∪ B ∪ C \\ G1 by aggregator avg:**

- Local score-aggregator avg ranking, restricted to
  `A ∪ B ∪ C` minus the miners already on this validator's
  Group 1 ballot.
- Miner must have **≥ 1** score record in the aggregator.
- No recency requirement — Group 2 is the slow-rotating reward tier
  and a miner with a single recorded score still qualifies.

These two ballots are what other validators see next cycle when
computing **their** chain-set tallies — the loop that drives the
C → B → A promotion above.

Score history older than `8 × cycle_length` blocks is pruned every
cycle (`MinerScoreAggregator.prune_before_round`). The avg never
reflects scores beyond that 8-cycle window, so a miner that goes idle
for 8+ cycles drops out of the upper tiers automatically.

---

## The non-A/B/C background extensions — eval coverage beyond the cohort

A miner that is not selected into this validator's `A ∪ B ∪ C` for the
cycle is **not excluded** from evaluation. `Round.freeze`
(`connito/validator/round.py`) extends `background_uids` with two
extra tiers — a previous-round A/B carry-over followed by a staleness
tail — so unranked and recently-rotated miners still get a chance to
accumulate score history.

Order of construction (`validator/round.py:408-440`):

1. **A → B → C background segment** — `(A ∪ B ∪ C) \\ foreground`,
   preserving A → B → C order. The consensus tier is processed first.

2. **Previous-round A/B carry-over tier** — every UID that was in
   the *previous* round's Group A or Group B but is not in this
   round's `cohort_set` (i.e. dropped out of A ∪ B ∪ C or foreground).
   Appended in (prev A, prev B) order. Within a cohort epoch where
   A/B are unchanged, this dedupes to a no-op; at a cohort boundary
   the previous epoch's leaders get one more eval pass before
   rotating out, so the handoff does not drop their scores.

3. **Staleness tail** — every other miner reachable through the
   validator's foreground/background pool that is not already in
   the cohort set or the carry-over tier.
   - **Pool** — effectively `(reachable miners) \\ (A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ foreground ∪ prev_AB_carryover)`.
   - **Order** — staleness desc (longest-since-last-evaluated first),
     random tiebreak. Equal-staleness UIDs rotate naturally across
     cycles.

Background workers (download + bg-eval) walk the queue in order,
so each extension runs only when the segments above it are fully
covered and there is spare capacity left in the round.

Effect on promotion: carry-over and tail miners earn score records
exactly like Group C miners do, which is what feeds the ≥ 1 / ≥ 3
record thresholds above and the rolling avg that drives the next
cycle's chain-set ballots. Without these extensions, a miner that
drops out of every validator's A ∪ B ∪ C for a cycle (or rotates
out of A/B at a cohort boundary) would have no opportunity to
accumulate history and would be stuck — they keep the C → B → A
path open even when the seeded Group C partition does not pick them.

---

## What keeps a miner out of every group (or out of weight emission)

- **No chain commitment / invalid checkpoint at freeze time.**
  UIDs without a usable `(hf_repo_id, hf_revision)` land in
  `freeze_zero_uids` and `finalize_round_scores` writes
  `score = 0` for that round. They still appear in the metagraph but
  are not evaluated and earn no reward (`Round.freeze` step 3).
- **Hotkey rotation.** When a UID's hotkey changes,
  `MinerScoreAggregator.add_score` resets that UID's history. The
  miner must re-accumulate the ≥ 3 / ≥ 1 record thresholds before it
  can re-appear in weight Group 1 / 2.
- **Validation failure.** Hash, signature, expert-group, or NaN/Inf
  failures during eval flag the UID in `validation_failed_uids`;
  `finalize_round_scores` writes `score = 0` for that round.
  Repeated failures pull the avg down and eventually push the miner
  out of the upper tiers via the chain-set tally.
- **Stale aggregator.** A miner that fails to record scores under
  **≥ 3 distinct round_ids within the last `5 × cycle_length` blocks**
  (3 of the last 5 cycles) fails the Group 1 recency gate and drops
  off this validator's top-`weight_group_1_size` ballot for the cycle.
  Group 2 has no recency gate — it only requires ≥ 1 record.
